Task-05: Network Packet Analyzer (Educational Packet Sniffer) ⚠️ IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER This project is developed strictly for educational and ethical purposes.

Use this tool only on networks you own or where you have explicit authorization Unauthorized packet sniffing may violate privacy laws and cybersecurity regulations The author is not responsible for misuse of this tool 📌 Project Overview This is a basic network packet analyzer (packet sniffer) written in Python. It captures live network traffic and displays:

Source IP address Destination IP address Network protocol (TCP / UDP / ICMP) Payload data (limited and safely decoded) This project helps learners understand:

How packet sniffers work Network protocols Why encryption (HTTPS, TLS) is important Defensive network security concepts ✨ Features Live packet capture Protocol detection (TCP, UDP, ICMP) Payload inspection (first few bytes only) Clean termination using CTRL + C No packet modification or injection No persistence or stealth behavior 🛠️ Requirements Python 3.8 or higher Administrator / Root privileges Visual Studio Code (recommended) Internet access (only for installing dependencies) 📦 Installation & Setup 1️⃣ Clone the Repository git clone https://github.com/your-username/network-packet-analyzer.git cd network-packet-analyzer 2️⃣ Open in VS Code code .

3️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended) python -m venv venv

Activate it:

Windows

venv\Scripts\activate 4️⃣ Install Dependencies pip install scapy

▶️ How to Run the Packet Analyzer

⚠️ Administrator / Root privileges required

Windows

Open VS Code as Administrator

Run:

python packet_sniffer.py 🧪 Example Output
Source IP : 192.168.1.10 Destination IP : 142.250.182.14 Protocol : TCP Payload : GET / HTTP/1.1

🔍 How It Works

Captures packets from the network interface

Checks for IP packets

Identifies protocol (TCP / UDP / ICMP)

Extracts source and destination IP addresses

Displays payload data safely (limited bytes)

Continues until manually stopped
